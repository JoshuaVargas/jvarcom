            <h1>Joshua Vargas</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a software developer with a focus on developing tools useful in the cybersecurity space. My areas of interest are network security, web app security, and network
                traffic analysis. Remember, you can't protect assets that you don't know you have, so make sure to keep your inventory management in check.
            </p>
            <p>
                I got my start in web development in the late 2000s when I was in high school thanks to my dad introducing me to Dreamweaver and ColdFusion. MySpace helped too. After
                showing a teacher what I'd been working on over the summer, I spun up a few static sites with him, handling the HTML and CSS while my teacher worked on the JavaScript
                side of things.
            </p>
            <p>
                Towards the end of high school, I got into writing and wrote articles for a furniture site, eventually assisting in moving the blog from ColdFusion to PHP and then to
                WordPress as we expanded our blog efforts to cover the top 100 cities in the US for some good old SEO gains. I mostly wrote, but I did the occasional development here
                and there. However, for almost a decade, writing was my bread and butter.
            </p>
            <p>
                After flirting with the game dev world for a bit as a QA Tester and then Localization on Editor for a few visual novels, I decided to learn about modern web dev. React,
                Flask, and ASP.NET Core were all eye openers. However, I still love to write some PHP. I also learned how unsecure web apps could be, so I decided to learn more about
                that, and that's where I am now.
